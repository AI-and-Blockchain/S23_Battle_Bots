# S23_Battle_Bots

## Project Motivation
We are hoping to create a competitive connect4 bot betting circuit. Where users are encouraged to use their computing power and computer science to train intelligent AIs for a chance to win against other competitors.

## User Story
As a computer science major and an avid gambler I want to use my knowledge of AI to train my very own connect4 bot so I can win money by betting on the blockchain.

### 4. Website

In order to get the website component up & running running, the following commands, in order, must be run while in the root folder of our repository

`cd website/src`

`npm install` *(this may take a while)*

`npm run serve`

That's it! Now, your terminal should've provided you with two URLs to visit the working site. If you want to view the site on your own machine, paste the URL that's next to the ***Local*** section into your web browser; if you want to view the site on another machine that's on the same network as the host machine, paste the URL that's next to the ***Network*** section into that computer's web browser.

**== NOTE: Our site was made strictly for 16:9 apsect ratio. The website is neither re-size friendly nor mobile-friendly. ==**
